# Freeze

**Type:** Bow/Crossbow Enchantment  
**Rarity:** Rare  
**Max Level:** 3

## Description

Arrows shot from a bow or crossbow enchanted with Freeze will freeze any living entity they hit. The target is immobilized for 3 seconds and up to 2 ice blocks will appear at random positions around them, encasing them in ice.

## Effects

- **On Hit:**
  - The target receives a powerful slowness effect (cannot move or jump) for 3 seconds.
  - Two ice blocks spawn at random positions around the target (never directly below), potentially trapping them.
- **Applicable To:** Bows and Crossbows.
- **Does Not Affect:** Entities immune to freezing or slowness effects.

## Strategy

- Use Freeze to stop fast or dangerous mobs in their tracks.
- Useful for crowd control or escaping from melee attackers.
- Works well in combination with ranged combat and other control enchantments.

## Compatibility

- Can be combined with other bow/crossbow enchantments unless restricted by Minecraft's vanilla rules.
